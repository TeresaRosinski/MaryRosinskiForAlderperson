            Real estate provides extensive knowledge of the challenges, hopes
            and dreams of individuals, families, business owners and investors
            to find properties for their futures. It also provides insights into
            the importance of clear community planning and zoning policies, as
            well as what communities need to have in order to attract people and
            businesses.
